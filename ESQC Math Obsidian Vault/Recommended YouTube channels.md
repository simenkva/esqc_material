## Michael Penn

Michael Penn is Professor of Mathematics at Randolph College in Virginia.

From his channel, "Math videos covering a wide variety of topics from theory to application. Calculus, Differential Equations, Number Theory, Proofs, unique problems and much more."

His videos are entertaining and avoid all the flash and glam associated with modern YouTube content.

## Graduate Mathematics

Link: http://www.youtube.com/@GraduateMathematics

A channel with a broad variety of videos. I find the old documentaries to be really worthwhile.

Video examples:
- [Fermat's Last Theorem (1993)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ymTZEeTjI8&t=32s)
- [Paul Erd≈ës: The Man Who Loved Only Numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9634A0iBw7w)
