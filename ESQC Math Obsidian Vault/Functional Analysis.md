Functional analysis can be viewed as infinite dimensional linear algebra. Here, complete normed spaces (Banach spaces) and complete inner product spaces (Hilbert spaces) are studied, along with linear operators between such spaces. Functional analysis is the foundation of quantum mechanics, as done by J. von Neumann. In a way, one can say that the development of functional analysis in the early 20th century was motivated by placing quantum mechanics on rigorous ground.

Functional analysis also provides the mathematical language for abstract treatment of PDEs such as the Schr√∂dinger equation, the Kohn--Sham approach to DFT, Maxwell's equations, and so on.

Functional analysis is a very useful topic for quantum chemists, especially when you want to navigate the more mathematics heavy literature.
